# Diversity and Inclusion Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Diversity and Inclusion Data Analytics Project! This project leverages Power BI to analyze and visualize key metrics related to diversity and inclusion within a telecom client's Human Resources department. The focus is on understanding gender balance, hiring practices, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover rates.

## Project Overview

Human Resources at our telecom client has been striving to improve gender balance at the executive management level. Despite their efforts, they have not seen significant progress. This project aims to identify and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help assess and improve diversity and inclusion within the organization. 

## Key Measures

The following measures are calculated to define proper KPIs:

- **# of men**: Total number of male employees.
- **# of women**: Total number of female employees.
- **# of leavers**: Total number of employees who have left the company.
- **% employees promoted (FY21)**: Percentage of employees who were promoted in the fiscal year 2021.
- **% of women promoted**: Percentage of female employees who were promoted.
- **% of hires men**: Percentage of new hires who are men.
- **% of hires women**: Percentage of new hires who are women.
- **% turnover**: Overall employee turnover rate.
- **Average performance rating: men**: Average performance rating of male employees.
- **Average performance rating: women**: Average performance rating of female employees.

## Relevant KPIs

### Hiring

- **Gender Ratio of New Hires**: Comparison of the percentage of men and women among new hires.
- **Diversity of New Hires**: Assessment of the diversity in the hiring process.

### Promotion
